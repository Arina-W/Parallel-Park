# Parallel-Park

[In this notebook] I modified the starter code that strings together a sequence of tasks to successfully parallel park 
my simulated car in a line of other cars, without hitting any of the other cars.

# Review

The ```park``` function causes the car to parallel park in the right lane without going off the road or hitting any of the other vehicles.
Below is a screen capture of my results:
